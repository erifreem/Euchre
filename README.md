# Euchre

This is a command-line application to play the card game Euchre, written in Java. I created this program to experiment with creating a basic AI framework for playing Euchre. Euchre is a great game in that its rules are simple and strict enough to create a simple AI framework based off of heurestics and basic probability, but the game contains enough variation and strategy to leave plenty of room for refining the details.

To play the game, just download the four java source files from the src folder and run the main function in the "Euchre.java" file. The game will pit you and an AI partner against two AI opponents.

Check out the wiki for information on the AI functions, the structure of the program, and the game of Euchre:
